## The (short) story

Wispr Flow raised **$81 million** to build a voice dictation app.  
I got annoyed, spent 3 months of late nights building my own version, and open-sourced it.

That's it.  
No funding. No team. Just one stubborn developer who hates subscriptions.

This is what open source is supposed to be.

---

## Why people actually use it

- Hold **Fn** → speak → release → clean, punctuated text appears **anywhere**
- Removes "um", "like", all fillers automatically
- Fixes grammar, can rephrase, bullet-point, or even generate text
- Tiny actions already work ("open YouTube", "set 5-min timer")
- **Fully offline** with local Whisper (tiny/base/small)
- Or blazing fast + free forever using Deepgram ($200 credits) + Gemini (1M tokens/day free)

**Zero tracking. Zero telemetry. Zero bullshit.**

## Jarvis vs $700M startups

| | **Jarvis** | The $700M one |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| 💰 Price | **Free forever** | $10–24/month |
| 🔇 Offline / Local | **Yes (Whisper)** | No |
| 🔓 Open Source | **Yes (MIT)** | No |
| 📡 Telemetry | **None** | ??? |
| 👨‍💻 Built by | **1 guy at 2am** | VC money |

---

## Quick setup (30 seconds)

1. Download & open the app
2. (Optional) paste free Deepgram + Gemini keys → unlimited speed  
   OR skip everything → switch to **Local Whisper** in Settings → 100% offline
3. Hold Fn and talk

That's literally it.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `Fn` (hold) | Start/stop recording |
| `Fn` (double-tap) | Toggle hands-free mode |
| `Escape` | Cancel recording |

---

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshayaggarwal99/jarvis-ai-assistant.git
cd jarvis-ai-assistant
npm install && npm run build && npm run dev
```

---

## Roadmap (help me choose!)

- [x] Proper "local-only" onboarding (no fake keys needed)
- [x] AWS Bedrock support
- [ ] Custom voice commands & prompts
- [ ] Windows version
- [ ] Clipboard magic & multi-step actions
- [ ] iOS (yes, I dream big)

Open issues, vote, or drop crazy ideas → [github.com/.../issues](https://github.com/akshayaggarwal99/jarvis-ai-assistant/issues)
